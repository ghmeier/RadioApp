				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be summer, but UCCS Radio is taking no breaks as it continues to improve its radio programming and presence at UCCS. This summer there will be twelve live programs, a record number for the summer programming.</p>
<p>“I think this goes to show that we have a very dedicated group of radio members on our team who truly want to give their UCCS community great programming no matter what time of year it is,” says UCCS Radio Manager Brandon Ortega. “My hope is that our community responds by tuning into these programs, we really offer a great service which is different than commercial radio and specific to this community, but the community has to support it by listening.”</p>
<p>One can listen to UCCS Radio online at radio.uccs.edu. The radio station offers a variety of programming including music and talk.</p>

<p>“Arjomandi has been instrumental in helping to create a positive relationship between the UCCS athletic department and UCCS Radio,” said station manager Brandon Ortega. Arjomandi is in his final semester of school and will graduate in May with a master’s degree in communication. He has also begun to further his radio career and is now a member of 1300 AM The Sports Animal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Colorado Colorado Springs Radio Station is off to a fiery start for the spring 2014 semester. The organization was awarded the 2012-2013 emerging club/organization award last April, which set the bar higher for this year’s group. The radio station and its members have responded to those higher expectations.</p>
<p>After a steady fall semester, the organization has added additional live programs to add value to listeners. New programs which have or are set to debut this semester include <i>Thursday Night Slow Jams</i>, <i>Gone Country</i>, <i>The Rebel Radio Show</i>, and <i>The Lion’s Den-Preview Show</i>. Additionally, the UCCS Chancellor Pam Shockley has made her return to the radio station with her program <i>The Chancellor’s Corner</i>.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to bring these new programs to UCCS Radio and we are always open to adding new programs and giving students, staff, and faculty the opportunity to educate themselves and others through radio,” said Station Manager Brandon Ortega. “UCCS has a diverse student group and I think our programs demonstrate that, we have a little bit of everything in our talk and radio programs.”</p>
<p>The radio station expects to continue to add programs this semester. UCCS students, staff, and faculty interested in starting a new program should contact Ortega at <a href="mailto:bortega@uccs.edu">bortega@uccs.edu</a>.</p>
